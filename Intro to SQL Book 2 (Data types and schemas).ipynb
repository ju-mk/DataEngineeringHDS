We also saw how this could be very problematic if 2 or more patients were to have the same name, as these changes would apply to all people who shared the same name. The way we overcome this in relational databases is to give each record a unique id, called a <code>primary key</code>. As well as this we can specify for each field what type of data we expect it to contain. Let’s see this in action as we recreate the previous <code>med_data</code> table with these new features.  "

At the time of writing this guide the salary for a band 5 (staff nurse) in the UK's NHS was between <strong>£24,907</strong> and <strong>£30,615</strong>. Make a constraint on the table so that salaries entered into the table in the field <code>salary</code> must be within this pay range. Also include a field called <code>staff_name</code> and one called <code>work_area</code> that <strong>cannot</strong> be empty, showing which ward or department the nurse works in.

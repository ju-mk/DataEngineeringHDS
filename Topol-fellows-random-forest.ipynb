    "This notebook introduces a Machine Learning algorithm called Random Forests which is built in turn on Decision Trees. We will apply these algorithms to some real world data introduced in another notebook Working with Data.  Random forests use the ‘wisdom of crowds’ to make their prediction, so for example, when you gather lots of the opinions in a crowd many individual ones will often be wrong but collectively the correct viewpoint usually becomes apparent.\n",

    "<code>Decision tree</code> algorithms were first introduced decades ago. Modern variants use these trees as the basis for more powerful techniques such as <code>random forests</code>, which are some of today's most powerful methods. It can be difficult to understand how some Machine Learning algorithms arrive at their conclusions. This has led to many of these algorithms being described as <a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/the-black-box-metaphor-in-machine-learning-4e57a3a1d2b0\" target=\"_blank\" >Black boxes</a>. One of the advantages of using decision trees and methods based on them is that they are much easier to explain and understand. "
